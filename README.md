Reflection:
So today we explored 6 new shaders which were, Material Vertex Fragment Shader, Simple Lighting Shadow Shader, Simple Shadow With Texture Shader, Glass Shader, Water Shader and the Water Scrolling Shader. I enjoyed today's activity, especially creating the different water shaders and seeing the differences between the two. 
The Water Shader gives us a proper wave effect, like water moving in the ocean by using a sine function. In comparison, the Water Scrolling Shader felt flatter when applied to the plane however it could be used as water coming down a clif to make a nice water fall. I felt that I understood these shaders a lot more easily compared to the 
rest as I didn't have difficulty understanding the process of making the shaders itself. My weakness today was when I was trying to debug the Glass Shader as I was having trouble with getting the transparency effect to work on the plane. I was unable to debug it on my own but was able to get help from a fellow student and I feel with 
their help today in fixing the issue, I will be able to correctly make the Glass Shader from now on.
